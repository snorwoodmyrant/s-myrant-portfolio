## 👋 About Me

I’m Sherria Myrant, an entry-level software engineer passionate about building clean, functional, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real-world problems, and continuously improving my craft.

- 🌱 Currently learning: [JavaScript, CSS, Python, HTML, SQL]
- 🔍 Interests: Web development, backend services, clean architecture
- 🎯 Career Goal: To grow into a full-stack developer and contribute to impactful products

## 🔭 Next on My Learning Path

I always strive to expand my knowledge and become a more versatile developer. Here are some of the technologies and languages I’m excited to dive deeper into next:

- **Java** – Learn object-oriented programming in an enterprise context
- **TypeScript** – Strengthen my understanding of static typing in modern JavaScript apps
- **C#** – Explore application development with .NET and game development with Unity
- **Go (Golang)** – Learn about concurrent programming and build efficient backend services
- **Rust** – Understand memory safety, systems-level development, and high-performance applications

These technologies represent a mix of practical backend tools and performance-focused languages that I believe will make me a more well-rounded engineer.
